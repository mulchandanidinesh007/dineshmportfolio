        "text": "Dinesh did an exceptional job completing a directed reading course on brain computer interfaces (BCI), which I was privileged to co-supervise. Dinesh demonstrated that he was able to very quickly learn the Python programming language and related libraries (PyGame, Scikit-Learn) which were instrumental to our research goals. Brain-computer interfaces are difficult technologies which draw on domain expertise from neuroscience, user experience, and machine learning. In order to complete this project, Dinesh demonstrated that he was able to work well with domain experts (neuroscientists) and effectively translate complex concepts into tangible, working software. The output of this course was a paper presented at the 2020 NeuroIS retreat-- no small feat for a course project! I believe that Dinesh is becoming the sort of of reflective and critical computer scientist, who truly drives a organization's value creation process forward. I wholeheartedly recommend him for both academic work and industry; he will not disappoint! ",
